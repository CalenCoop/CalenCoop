## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

Iâ€™m big on clean code, thoughtful design, and understanding the "why" behind the tools we use.  
I gravitate toward backend work but love bridging the gap between frontend usability and system-level thinking.  
My background in psychology and sales gives me an edge in understanding peopleâ€”something I try to bring to both my code and my collaboration style.

## ðŸŽµ Fun Fact

Iâ€™ve been teaching myself piano for the past few yearsâ€”debugging sheet music isnâ€™t that different from debugging code.  
If you ever want to talk music, dev tools, or big ideas, Iâ€™m all ears.
